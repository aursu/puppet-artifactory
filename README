Recommended minimal JVM parameters

The larger your repository or number of concurrent users, the larger you need to
make the -Xms and -Xmx values accordingly. Recommended minimal values are:

    -server -Xms512m -Xmx2g -Xss256k -XX:+UseG1GC

For more recommendations about your hardware configuration (especially the -Xmx
parameter), please refer to Recommended Hardware:

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/System+Requirements#SystemRequirements-RecommendedHardware


Where you set your JVM parameters depends on how you are running Artifactory:

For a manual installation, modify
    JAVA_OPTIONS in $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/bin/artifactory.default.

For a service installation, modify
    JAVA_OPTIONS  in $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/default

(you will need to stop and then restart the service after making the
modification)

For an RPM or Debian installation, modify
    JAVA_OPTIONS in /etc/opt/jfrog/artifactory/default
